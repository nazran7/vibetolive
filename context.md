# VibeToLive.dev — Turn Your AI-Generated Prototype Into a Production-Grade Product

**Prototype fast. Ship right.** VibeToLive.dev is the launch ramp for solopreneurs, indie hackers, and lean teams who are vibecoding with AI tools to get from idea to running code—only to hit the wall when it’s time to harden, secure, scale, and actually *ship*. We take your AI‑written (or AI‑accelerated) codebase and make it live in production—safely, reliably, and with a foundation you can grow on.

## Why You Need VibeToLive

AI coding assistants are fantastic for getting from zero to “something that runs,” but the resulting code is often less secure, harder to maintain, and full of inconsistencies. Developers frequently spend extra time reviewing and fixing AI-generated code. Meanwhile, pushing quick hacks straight to prod piles up technical debt—slowing future feature work, raising maintenance costs, and increasing failure risk as your app grows.

Production readiness is more than “it works on my laptop.” Mature teams use structured checklists to confirm security baselines, scalability, reliability, observability, CI/CD hygiene, and rollback plans before launch. Cloud providers echo this discipline with frameworks built around operational excellence, security, reliability, and performance.

Security hygiene also starts early. The most common vulnerabilities in web apps are well known, yet continue to show up in rushed or auto-generated code.

## Our Offer: Three Focused Service Tracks

### 1. **Vibe → Live**  *(Production-Readiness & Launch)*

**Flat Price:** \$499
**Turnaround:** \~1 work week (5 business days) from intake completion & access granted.

**What’s Included:**

* Rapid codebase intake + light audit to confirm project builds & runs.
* Minimal, targeted remediation required to get the current feature set deployable (we do *just enough* to make it stable in prod—no major feature changes).
* Baseline security & configuration pass (env vars, secrets handling, auth config, basic hardening).
* Production readiness checks: build reproducibility, dependency pinning/licensing review, basic logging, health checks, and rollback path.
* Lightweight observability hooks (logs + minimal metrics) so you can see what’s happening after go‑live.
* CI/CD pipeline wiring (or integration with your existing system) for repeatable deploys.
* Deploy to your chosen cloud target (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, Fly.io, Render, etc.) following best practices.

**What’s *Not* Included:**

* No major new features.
* No broad bug‑hunt or deep refactors beyond what’s required to ship.
* No full design/UX overhaul.

**Ideal When:** You have an MVP/prototype that “mostly works,” need to show traction, demo to investors, or onboard first paying users *now*, and can live with the current feature set for a bit.

### 2. **Add Some Spice**  *(Enhance, Fix, Polish & Launch)*

**Starts at:** \$999 (final cost based on scoped work).
**Timeline:** Determined by scope; we’ll estimate after discovery call & code review.

**Everything in Vibe → Live, plus:**

* Prioritized feature additions or integrations.
* Targeted bug triage & fixes across critical flows.
* UI/UX refresh passes—from cosmetic tweaks to component swaps (as agreed).
* Performance tuning, load‑test guided scaling, infra right‑sizing.
* Technical debt reduction sprints focused on the hotspots that will slow you down later.

**Engagement Model:** We collaborate to define a mini‑roadmap, lock scope, quote, and sprint to launch. Additional iterations available as change orders.

### 3. **Keep It Alive** *(Ongoing Maintenance)*

**Monthly Price:** \$250/month

**What’s Included:**

* Monthly health checks, dependency updates, and security patching.
* Uptime and performance monitoring dashboard access.
* Hotfix deployment for critical bugs or outages.
* Up to 2 hours of monthly development time for small changes or tweaks.
* Priority support channel with next-business-day response.

**What’s *Not* Included:**

* New feature development (can be scoped separately).
* Major refactors or UI/UX overhauls.
* Emergency 24/7 incident response (available as separate retainer).

**Ideal When:** You want peace of mind that your app stays secure, up-to-date, and functional after launch—without hiring full-time help.

## How Engagement Works

**1. Quick Fit Call →** We confirm tech stack, repo access, current deployment state, and which service track fits.
**2. Secure Intake →** You grant read access; we perform a lightweight code + infra scan to identify blockers to prod readiness.
**3. Scope Lock →** Fixed deliverables (Vibe → Live) or scoped backlog (Add Some Spice) with schedule & payment milestone.
**4. Hardening Sprint →** Apply readiness checklist items: security/config, build pipeline, logging/metrics, rollback hooks, basic tests.
**5. Cloud Deploy & Smoke Test →** Stand up prod (or staging→prod) in target cloud.
**6. Handoff & Next Steps →** You get documentation, runbooks-on-a-page, and options for ongoing support or Spice engagement.

## What You Get Out of This

**Speed to Market Without the Blindfold** – Launch fast *and* with the guardrails that keep you from spending the next six months firefighting. Production readiness and rollback planning reduce deployment risk.

**Security Hygiene from Day One** – Applying baseline checks and secret/config discipline early lowers exposure to common web app threats.

**Architecture that Scales** – Aligning to proven cloud pillars means your first launch won’t box you in later.

**Less Compounding Tech Debt** – Addressing the messy edges of AI‑accelerated prototypes before growth prevents the interest‑on‑interest spiral that drags velocity.

**Focused Use of AI** – We embrace AI for rapid iteration but put human review, hardening, and operational rigor around it so you don’t ship insecure, brittle code.

## FAQs

**Q: Do you rewrite everything?**
**A:** No. We remediate what’s required to ship (Vibe → Live) or what’s in the agreed enhancement scope (Add Some Spice). Anything bigger becomes a separate project.

**Q: What clouds do you support?**
**A:** Most major clouds + modern PaaS targets. We follow architecture best practices without locking you into a single vendor.

**Q: Do you run security scans?**
**A:** Yes—lightweight scans & config checks in Vibe → Live; deeper scanning and patching available in Add Some Spice.

**Q: Will you monitor my app after launch?**
**A:** Only with the Keep It Alive plan. Basic monitoring setup is included in the initial engagement, but ongoing support and updates are not provided unless you subscribe.
